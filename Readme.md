# Encrypted Text Messages

OVERVIEW

Encrypt a text message using a one-time key.

CONCEPT
 A one-time pad or key provides a secure method of encrypting a message provided the key is secured, random and not reused.
 The key is the same length of the message.
 One-time pads rely on synchronous keys. Sender and receiver use the same key to encrypt and decrypt the message. This means this message is not appropriate for broadcasting a message to more than one person.
 The method is designed to secure the message while en route and not as a means for storing a message.
 Keys that are reused or compromised leaves the message vulnerable to cracking.
 Strict procedures are required for the safe use of this method. Human error in following these procedures results in vulnerable messages.

OBJECTIVE
 Implement a one-time pad process on a short text message.
 A user enters both a plaintext message and key to create a cyphertext message.
 A receiver decrypts the cyphertext using the key.
 The message would be limited to 180 characters and thus would be appropriate for SMS, Twitter etc.
 Only uppercase letters of the Latin alphbet are used in the cyphertext (i.e, A to Z). Spaces, punctuation marks etc in the plaintext are ignored.

LIMITATIONS
 The creation of a random key. Non-random keys could result in successful brute force attacks or letter frequency attacks.
 Security of the key. Anyone with the key could decrypt the message.
 Loss of the key or an inaccurate key results in lost or unreadable messages.
 Appropriate for short messages.
 Synchronizing keys between sender and receiver.
 Text message limited to 26 letters of Latin alphabet.
 Time consuming to generate key, sync keys and to encrypt and decrypt.
