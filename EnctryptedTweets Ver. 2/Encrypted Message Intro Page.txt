Encrypt Message

Plaintext + Key = Ciphertext
Ciphertext - Key = Plaintext

This program encrypts a 140 character message using the one-time pad system. The algorithm is: plaintext plus a key creates a ciphertext.

Your message is converted to plaintext. Plaintext is lowercase-alpha characters. Punctuation, spaces and numbers are removed.

The key is derived from the value of playing cards. Randomly select cards from a deck and enter the values. The card values are first validated then saved to a file and used to create a key on a first-in, first-out basis.

The number of cards entered must be as long as your message. One card for each character of your message. This is the basis of the one-time pad system.

If there is a sufficient number of cards, the program will generate a key, and from these data, create the ciphertext.

To finalize the process, save the message details. The cards used to create the key are removed from the list of available cards and a log file with information about the message is saved on your hard drive.

Given a key and ciphertext, you can determine the plaintext.
